I think and write about technology and society. Sometimes I build things too. Lately I've been obsessed with
the following question:

|How should we govern our digital institutions?|
|---------------------------------|

I take an interdisciplinary lens, which can mean exploring the implications of antitrust law or finding the equilibrium of a collective choice mechanism. Right now, though, I'm examining the governance
of open source machine learning projects.

I'm a CS Master's student at MIT, where I also graduated in 2021 with a
degree in Computer Science (while also dabbling in economics and philosophy). Because of a generous grant from [Open Philanthropy](https://www.openphilanthropy.org), I'm working with Dylan Hadfield-Menell to examine the past and future of open source machine learning through an institutional lens.

In addition to my work with Dylan, I'm part of the [Metagovernance
Project](https://metagov.org/), where I'm currently looking at digital
governance in the emerging landscape of Web3. 

In the past, I've been a data research analyst at the wonderful [Center for Security and
Emerging Technology](https://cset.georgetown.edu/), a policy intern at the [Office of Science and Technology Policy](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/), and a researcher at the [MIT Computational Cognitive Science group](https://cocosci.mit.edu/).

Intellectual influences of mine include [Elinor Ostrom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elinor_Ostrom), [Nadia Eghbal](https://nadiaeghbal.com/), and [David Chapman](https://meaningness.com/about-my-sites). I am deeply grateful to them and their mutuals for inspiring me and shaping my worldview.


My mailing list is for the occasional personal update and reflection. My
