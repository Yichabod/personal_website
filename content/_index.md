I think and write about technology and society. Sometimes I build things too. Lately I've been obsessed with
the following question:

|How should we govern our digital institutions?|
|---------------------------------|

I take an interdisciplinary lens, which can mean exploring the implications of antitrust law or finding the equilibrium of a collective choice mechanism. Right now, though, I'm examining the governance
of open source machine learning projects.

I'm a CS Master's student at MIT, where I also graduated graduated in 2021 with a
degree in Computer Science (with much dabbling also in economics and philosophy). Because of a generous grant from [Open Philanthropy](https://www.openphilanthropy.org), I'm directing my own research project and working loosely with a number of ethnographers, developers, and otherwise interdisciplinary people.

In the past, I've been a data research analyst at the wonderful [Center for Security and
Emerging Technology](https://cset.georgetown.edu/), a policy intern at the [Office of Science and Technology Policy](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/), and a researcher at the MIT Computational Cognitive Science group.

Intellectual influences of mine include Elinor Ostrom, Nadia Eghbal, and David Chapman. I am deeply grateful to them and their mutuals for inspiring me and shaping my worldview.

My mailing list is for the occasional personal update and reflection. My
Substack is for more regular updates on my open source governance research. You
