# Gorgeous Chemical Fires

Note: you are one of a small number of people getting this update (because I care about you or else you are sasha chapin). Perhaps it should go without out saying but I request that you please don’t share this without asking beforehand. (Subnote: the original version of this was hosted on substack and I've repasted it here so all the links are missing)

As I start this letter, I am 10,000 meters above the ground, squeezed between two strangers with a polypropylene mask over my face. The man to my right is pale and wears a furry brown Patagonia. He sleeps with a New Yorker open in his lap. The man to my left has a blue hoodie with the word 'Richezz' emblazoned with a lightning yellow font.

I am on my way to Los Angeles to meet my good friends Tuomas and Sungwoo.

This year was denser than ever.

In numbers:

- 10 essays
- 1 poetry collection (~12 poems)
- 3 songs (two covers)
- 1 Bachelor of Science 
- 7 classes
- 1/2 a Master's thesis
- 8 states
- 2 amorous sojourns

Of all the yearly updates, this one has been the hardest to convey. A lot happened on the surface (new friends, new research, different locations etc) but for me a lot of the change was emotional, painful, and internal. What makes it hard for me to communicate is how idiosyncratic it all felt, and how messy the change was. The result is a series of vignettes.

## Recount

### I. On the surface, all is well

Cambridge, MA. In the month of January before the spring semester begins, we undergraduates have time to frolic.

Me, sitting with my desk perpendicular to Tuomas’ in our dimly lit apartment in Central Square; both of us working furiously on our stock trading bot. I notice a twinge of pain at the base of my right palm as I type.

Walking through snow & slicing wind to get to G’s apartment to watch an Armenian-Canadian film. Sitting, rapt, next to her and noticing her smell. Something’s amiss.

The tightness of my chest as I prepare in the final minutes for my grant interview with Open Philanthropy. Me hurriedly emailing the interviewer afterward with a fermi estimate of a question I’d failed to answer on the spot.

### II. When a fire starts to burn

The semester begins; heat spreads. 

Feeling not worry, but incredulity, as my forearms flare after each keystroke. The heat rises and rises until I can’t distinctly move my middle and ring fingers. Frustration masked with laughter as I realize I can neither open the round doorknob to my room nor chop the broccoli for my stir fry. What the fuck?

There are bugs. While calling MIT disability services — ‘yeah, we get a couple cases of this every semester’ — I feel a crawling over the hairs of my left shin. The insect is small. So small that I can scarcely tell whether it is a crumple of lint or wingless arthropod. So small that I worry I am delusional and only imagining things. My only consolation is the tiny red welt that forms on my leg in the next hour.

The doctor at MIT Medical shakes his head, suggesting I see an acupuncturist or a physiotherapist; the physiotherapist gives me an exercise inflames my forearm further; the acupuncturist estimates between four weeks and four months for recovery as he sticks the twelfth needle in my arm. The bug man ignores the texts I send after he takes away the samples of insects I’d carefully plucked from my body. 

After watching a video of a pink-haired woman who had learned to code with only her voice, I join an online community of developers who cannot use a physical keyboard. I start to imagine what it would be like to live without my hands.

These weeks I live out of the apartment living room — lying face-up on the sofa with immobile wrists at the side of my body. I use a mixture of voice commands, my index fingers and my opposable thumbs to slowly operate my computer. 

Yet still I was laughing inside — maybe I should write a Kafkaesque story — and then I remembered that I could hardly type.

### III. “When was the last time you forgave yourself?”

Release.

In the early afternoon of March 22nd, something changes. I finish listening to an audiobook and do an exercise. Three days later the pain is almost entirely gone.

The roaring heat inside my chest, the abandoned little boy with a razor scooter, the screaming man with taut neck cords - ‘you ungrateful piece of shit’ , the pressure at my temples, the clenched fists. 

I am hiding from myself. 

It empties out gradually. First it’s the outside of my forearm. Then it’s the muscles between my scapulae. Even my hips soften and, after four years, I can run again. I still feel the residue — it’s not ‘all gone’ — but it’s really different than before.

G turning away to smudge a tear as I tell her that it won’t work out between us. Adjusting my wrist brace as I walk down Main street back to my apartment.

Noam Chomsky calls the CIA operatives in South America a ‘network of terrorist mercenary states’.

One hand holding a beer, and the other squeezing Tuomas’ shoulder. We stand at the peak of Middlesex Fells, howling and laughing until the breaking of twigs betrays a stranger close by. Crouching behind rocks and hiding.

Face up in bed, slowly opening my eyes from a distant dream. The corners of my eyes are damp. I think I was dreaming of Ashley.

### IV. I am a somewhat something wandering on a dreamlike fading road

Chicago, IL; Los Angeles, CA; San Francisco, CA; Lexington, VA

Restless in summertime.

Starting my DOD-Intelligence Community-adjacent summer job as a program manager. 

“Are you excited to work for the U.S. Intelligence Community?”  my mentor had asked me during my interview.

Clutching my head in wild-eyed despair & agonizing in boredom at the three-hour meeting on the federal contract procurement process. I don’t know if I can do this technology policy thing.

Forcing myself to breathe deeply in the front of an old Mercedes sedan outside Number Six as I send her the message. Slumping hard into the seat, shielding my face from the heat of the outside sun.

Holding her hand as we walk towards the faux Venice canals. Four months since we last talked. She can’t start right now. Me, at last with permission, sobbing sobbing.

Wave hands like clouds; brush knee, step, twist, push. Tai-chi with Nick and his girlfriend Jenny.

She bid me take life easy, as grass grows on the weirs,
But I was young and foolish, and am now full of tears.

### V. How can the ductal cell know the tear it releases down the cheek of a twelve year old girl?

San Francisco, CA; Cambridge, MA.
Carried by the tides, a boy catches hold of a raft.

Waking up at six, sitting silent for two hours, reading about Vajrayana, walking to the beach. Laughing as sand childlike slips through palm as I lay between the road and the sea.

One crystalline thought: 

I am enough 
& this great knowing,
all I need.

Standing in a circle of dozens of cross-legged people — some friends, most strangers — getting lost in a painful memory as I tell about family darkly. Lifted from my sunken isolation by Ethan and Julia, who invite me to play ping pong. 

Watching stars in a lidless sky with twenty new friends. Worrying aloud about the ticks in the grass beneath us as our shoulders gently touch. 

Gesturing with gusto at the dinner table at why I hate decision theory, a new friend smiling and nodding.

The ponytail on Dylan, my thesis advisor, as he slowly lays bare my assumptions about the importance of open source software. Thrilled, my mind races — gratitude for being challenged and encouraged with such skillful means.

Déwang and Traktung answering with grace my question about how to respond to violence in the world. Singing the Seven Line Song of Padmasambhava. 

Flipping, yelling, punching my mattress with fury as I contemplate the fact that I likely have COVID. Freedom and jubilance after voicing anger.

Everything feels in its right place. After slipping and falling into the sea , I’ve climbed back aboard. Life’s tides have brought me here and although I see the storms ahead, I’m not scared.

On lessons

What can I say of the lessons I’ve learned? 

Attending to inner states is one of the most valuable skills; the mind and body are not neatly divisible; it’s not uncommon to get everything you wanted and still be unhappy; a weekly reflection/check-in can save you from pernicious emotional traps; neither ascetic Buddhism nor a career adjacent to the U.S. intelligence community is for me; pay attention to suppressed anger.

## On books

2021 was a year of potent nonfiction. I read several books that I consider distinct milestones in my developmental roadmap. Perhaps the most flattering thing I can say about these books is that I was burning and they saved me.

John Sarno’s Healing Back Pain did the most to directly address my RSI, but it was really a combination of Jay Earley’s Introduction to Internal Family Systems and Eugene Gendlin’s Focusing (audiobook version) that taught me how to actively feel my emotions. Schwartz’s You Are the One You’ve Been Waiting For and Dan Brown’s Attachment Disturbances in Adults taught me how to recognize and heal damage in intimate relationships. With the exception of Healing Back Pain (I’ve since found a newer alternative), these are core books I expect to return to over the next couple of years.

Somewhat related is the inversion of my previous perspective on Buddhism. This was largely aided by David Chapman’s Vividness, but I have also thoroughly enjoyed the Aro gTer teachings that underlie Vividness. Emailing the Lamas from Afar was a great introduction to Ngak’chang Rinpoche and Khandro Dechen’s lighthearted and humorous approach. An Odd Boy, volume 1 is NCR’s personal memoir about growing up as a little Bluesman in South England. Wisdom Eccentrics tells the story of his travel to Tibet (though MORE). I’ll also mention Chapman’s (unfinished) Buddhism for Vampires because it made me shudder and read on, late into the night.

My four most enjoyable nonfiction reads this year were Impro (improvisation as unintended life philosophy; reverse to learn), Storyworthy (superb guide to storytelling; prompted me to tell a story to those dozens of strangers), Words Without Music (an inspiring, hilarious, engrossing autobiography by one of the greatest living composers), and The Dream Machine (a history of the internet featuring the indelibly haunted death of von Neumann). 

I didn’t read a lot of fiction I liked this year. Coetzee’s The Disgrace was maybe the best written (about an English professor in South Africa who gets involved in a scandal — to me it evoked Williams’ Stoner). Aldous Huxley’s Island was gripping but felt naive and at times dogmatic (‘everyone would be cured if we just gave them psychedelics’). The Strugatsky brothers’ Roadside Picnic was thrilling but didn’t leave a lasting impression. Normal People was ok; I didn’t really like Parable of the Sower, and I much preferred Ted Chiang’s Exhalation to his Story of Your Life.

### Other good stuff:

Governing the Commons, Ostrom. This changed my research focus and I have since been firmly on the Ostrom train (or rather an aspiring member of the Ostrom workshop). ‘How to think with the rigor of an economist but not fall into their (sometimes) dogmatic trappings on how to govern’.

Understanding Power: The Indispensable Chomsky. Provocative in the best way. If you haven’t read Chomsky or his contemporaries, I challenge you to read this and not revise your perspective.

Metaphors We Live By, Lakoff and Johnson. Understanding that metaphors are deeply intertwined with the structure of human thought.

Finding Our Sea Legs, Buckingham (stories as ethics, dense and am still reading)

### Things I am currently reading and excited about:
The Dawn of Everything, Graeber and Wengrow
The Portable Hannah Arendt 
The Timeless Way of Building, Alexander
Trickster Makes This World, Hyde
Spectrum of Ecstasy, Ngak’chang Rinpoche and Khandro Dechen

### Honorable mentions but not really recommended:

The WEIRDest People in the World: How the West Became Psychologically Peculiar and Particularly Prosperous (good but references several experiments that don’t replicate). 
Great Founder Theory (written in simple just-so prose but I didn’t find most of his ideas that useful)

## On Essays

Renunciation is the Vehicle for Most of Buddhism and Developing ethical, social, and cognitive competence. (Most influential reads of the year for me)

How to evaluate a study. (When I asked a certain nobel prize-winning economics professor how to evaluate an empirical study, he shrugged and suggested I should have studied economics. This is the post I wish he pointed me to)

The Moral Character of Cryptography (conflicted re the moralistic tone)
On movies and TV

Song of the Sea, Tomm Moore. Movie of the year for me. Beautiful Irish animation with a stunning soundtrack to back it up. I love most things Irish, but I think this movie certainly holds its own against some of the lesser Ghibli films.

### Other high quality watches this year:

In the Mood For Love, Wong-kar Wai 

The Music Room, Satyajit Ray

The Sweet Hereafter, Atom Egoyan

### On music

Japanese jazz (Ryuichi Sakamoto, Hako Miyazaki, Ryo Fukui) and Portuguese-Brazilian (Silva, Lamparina, Baden Powell, Tom Jobim) featured most heavily, but I repeatedly listened to everyone ranging from Still Woozy to Bach’s Preludes.

My most listened to song this year was Soprou by Silva. Here is a Spotify playlist of my favorite songs of 2021.
Favorite podcast of the year

Tyler Cowen interviews Dana Gioia on Poetry.

    COWEN: Do you, like Auden, crave a social function for poetry?
    GIOIA: I think poetry has a social function but it’s a relatively complicated and subtle one, which is to say, the reason that we have art is, in a sense, to increase human happiness. It does that, essentially, on an individual level. A work of art awakens you. It awakens you to the possibilities of your own potential. It takes that potential, it enlarges it, it refines it, and each art does it in different ways. Music appeals to the auditory sense, an organizational, formal structure in the mind. Painting is visual. Sculpture is visual and tactile. In the old days, people always would feel sculptures. Poetry is to our language and our emotional functions. They awaken emotions and awaken our ability to articulate them.

## What I produced

Two newsletters. (old, new)

A new website.

A couple of decent essays: one on Ostrom’s conception of institutions, one on pruning in brains and machines, another on Kegan’s developmental psychology applied to Phillip Glass. Separately, a syllabus for exploring your values.

### My plans for the year

People love to ask what my plans are for the upcoming year. The truth is that I do not know. I hope to graduate with my master’s thesis by August at the latest. I hope to play some piano and keep writing. I’ll probably have to find (or create) a job at some point.

Some ambitions:

    Write an essay series making Elinor Ostrom’s teachings broadly accessible

    Write an essay series summarizing every class I took at MIT

    Have a solid jazz piano repertoire of three new songs (solo + comping)

    Finish my thesis on time + make it accessible for people (a pretty report, an op-ed somewhere, maybe a dedicated website?)

    Find quests worthy of the next couple years (any suggestions?)

    Learn 15 poems (this year I only got to 10 out of 30)

    Host or attend an event that directly helps other people

    Feel the same stillness I experienced on retreat at Blue Cliff two years ago

### Some quotes about fire

“Love is the substance with which I am made. Love is a river which sweeps me along, but I am the river; it is a tiger which destroys me, but I am the tiger; it is a fire which consumes me, but I am the fire.” 

“People are somewhat gorgeous collections of chemical fires, aren’t they?”

“If your house were burning down and you could take away one thing, what would it be?”
“I’d take the fire.”

How are things on your end? I would love to hear, especially if we haven’t spoken in a while.

Wishing you tranquility,

Max
