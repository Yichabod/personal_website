# Why I'm researching open source ML

The story I tell depends on whether I'm writing a grant or talking to a collaborator. The short honest reason I tell myself is that it's fun and probably useful, which I'd contend are basically the two most useful criteria when making decisions about work.

It's fun because I love trying new things.

It's probably useful because open source ML is important yet neglected.

If we want to understand the trajectory of artificial intelligence, it's important to understand the governance of the underlying software infrastructure.

In my grant application, I pointed out that most discussions of the AI [production function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Production_function) talk about algorithms, data, talent, and compute, but make no mention of the underlying software infrastructure. Virtually all machine learning researchers and developers use open source tools like [PyTorch](pytorch.org/) and [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/). These are *entirely free*, and which, in principle, anyone can contribute to<sup id="a1">[1](#g1)</sup>. (Note that this is a historical anomaly)


I also study the open source ecosystem because I think it's beautiful. I hope to
better capture this in a future post, but suffice it for now to say that there
is a richness of culture and generosity in the open source space that brings me
hope for the future. More on this soon.
