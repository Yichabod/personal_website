This is a collection for the most important things I have learned from reading Elinor Ostrom. It is not comprehensive (for that you might turn to the [Four Volume tome](https://rowman.com/ISBN/9781786614346/Exploring-the-Political-Economy-and-Social-Philosophy-of-Vincent-and-Elinor-Ostrom) published by Lexington press). These are just some of the insights that I found most striking.

My plan for the series:
1. [What is an institution? Introducing 'A Grammar'](https://maxlangenkamp.me/posts/institution/)
2. An overview of Institutional Analysis and Development
3. Reflections on 'Governing the Commons'
4. ...(TBD)
