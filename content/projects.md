### Projects
- [plugging in a USB: what's the worst that can happen?](/BadUSB.pdf). Where some friends and I use a Raspberry Pi Zero to inject malicious keystrokes into my computer. For MIT's Computer Systems Security class (6.858).
- [deep learning with satellite data](https://towardsdatascience.com/deep-learning-with-satellite-data-b78b20708de). A writeup of the landslide detection project I did as a visiting researcher at University of Sannio.
- [building an arduino sleep tracking device](https://medium.com/@Yichabod/the-difficulty-with-tracking-sleep-4dffbed6bbab). An IoT project I did in Freshman year with some friends for MIT's Embedded Systems class (6.08).
- [using LSTMs to imagine how Shakespeare would have rapped](https://medium.com/@Yichabod/how-would-shakespeare-have-rapped-a-practical-implementation-of-lstms-for-text-synthesis-2fece570eb8e). My first ever real programming project.
